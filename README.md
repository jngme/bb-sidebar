# BB Sidebar

A stable thread list for [bb](https://github.com/get-bb/bb). Threads stay where you put them while status, snooze, and settle actions remain close at hand.

## Features

- Manual ordering plus Recent activity, Date created, and Project sort modes
- Subtle project grouping for projects with multiple active threads
- Pinned, Active, Inactive, Snoozed, Parked, and Settled shelves
- Project filtering
- Automatic project icons with custom overrides
- Expandable child-thread indicators with running and attention states
- Live status, branch, pull request, and provider details
- Workspace port discovery, hover-card details, and optional browser links
- Configurable inactive-thread and automatic cleanup rules
- Native bb navigation, split, rename, archive, and delete flows
- Project submenu on thread cards for settings, rename, local paths, and removal
- Regenerate a thread title from its last three accepted user messages

## Install

```sh
bb plugin install git:https://github.com/yusuf8834/bb-sidebar.git
```

Then choose **BB Sidebar** under **Settings > Appearance > Sidebar**.

## Command line

Agents and scripts can settle threads the same way the sidebar does:

```sh
bb sidebar settle <threadId...>
bb sidebar unsettle <threadId...>
bb sidebar settle --when-idle <threadId...>
bb sidebar cancel-settle <threadId...>
bb sidebar settle-status <threadId...>
```

`settle` matches the **Settle** action. `unsettle` matches **Restore** on the Settled shelf. Each takes up to 50 thread ids. `settle` refuses a thread that is still working. See [skills/bb-sidebar/SKILL.md](skills/bb-sidebar/SKILL.md) for output and exit codes.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build
bb plugin install path:. --yes
```

## Credits

This project includes code adapted from [bb-plugin-t3sidebar](https://github.com/SawyerHood/bb-plugin-t3sidebar). Its MIT copyright notice remains in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Park threads while waiting on someone else. Use **Park thread** in the context menu and **Resume** when ready. Parked threads have no timer and are excluded from automatic cleanup. Opening one leaves it parked; new thread activity brings it back to Active.

Use **Parent** in a thread's context menu to search threads in the same project, choose a parent, or select **None** to remove it. The current parent is checked; the thread itself and its descendants are excluded.
